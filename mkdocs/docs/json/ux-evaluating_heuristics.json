However, while waiting for these results, everything that was before pressing the \"Find Tickets\" button was reflected on the screen. Note: No requirements yet. Imagine that the product owner said that the expected result should meet the features (principles) of the heuristics. In this case, would you, as a tester, be satisfied with the above behavior of the system?\"\nAI MODEL \"As an AI language model, I cannot have personal opinions or feelings, but as a tester, I would need to evaluate the behavior of the system against the heuristics principles and determine if it meets the expected features. If the system\u0027s behavior aligns with the heuristics principles and meets the product owner\u0027s expectations, then I would be satisfied with the above behavior of the system. However, if it does not meet the heuristics principles or the product owner\u0027s expectations, then further testing and refinement may be necessary.\""
